---
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example1:

    Input: "abcabcbb"

    Output: 3 

    Explanation: The answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Example2:

    Input: "bbbbb"

    Output: 1

    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example3:

    Input: "pwwkew"

    Output: 3

    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 

                 Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

    s = "pwapkew"
    slist = list(s)
    anslist = slist[0]
    anslist2 = []
    i = 1
    while i < len(s):
        flg = 0
        j = 0
        for j in range(len(anslist)):
            if slist[i]==anslist[j]:
                flg = 1
                break
        if flg==0:
            anslist = anslist + slist[i]
        else:
            if len(anslist)>len(anslist2):
                anslist2 = anslist
            i = i-len(anslist)+1+j
            anslist = slist[i]
        i = i+1

    if len(anslist)>len(anslist2):
        anslist2 = anslist
    print(anslist2)
